<h2 class="nobreak">STORY OF THE SKETCH</h2>



<p>Susan and Rubber-Neck keep a country hotel advertised
as &#8220;very quiet.&#8221; Miss Calcium, an actress, comes with her
wardrobe in one suit-case. &#8220;You may stay just one day on
that baggage.&#8221; Rubber-Neck wants to be an actor. Miss
Calcium&#8217;s attempt at tragedy scares Rubber-Neck and Susan.
&#8220;This is a quiet hotel.&#8221; She shows them how to do it.
&#8220;You are tied to the track.&#8221; &#8220;Hold on, maybe dat train
don&#8217;t stop here.&#8221; The thrilling rescue scene. Rubber-Neck&#8217;s
train of cars. &#8220;You&#8217;re both real actors. We&#8217;ll do
a sister act in vaudeville.&#8221; &#8220;All right; it&#8217;s better than
keeping a quiet hotel.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">COSTUMES</h2>



<p><span class="smcap">Miss Calcium.</span> Traveling suit and hat, very pronounced
and dashing in style. She may be anywhere from twenty
to forty in age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Smart chambermaid&#8217;s costume, with rather short
skirt, and a neat little apron. Age, twenty to thirty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rubber-Neck.</span> Black face (or white, if preferred). May
be of any age. Wears dark trousers, gingham shirt, and a
uniform cap with word &#8220;Porter&#8221; on front. Costume may
be made comic as desired.</p>





<h2 class="nobreak">PROPERTIES</h2>



<p>For Miss Calcium, dress-suit case and umbrella. For
Rubber-Neck, child&#8217;s train of cars, dinner-bell, whistle.
For Susan, call-bell.</p>

<p>The noise of an approaching train is easily imitated behind
scenes with a piece of sheet-iron which is struck with
two beaters similar to egg beaters. This effect may, however,
be omitted if preferred, as the action does not absolutely
depend on it.</p>

Hotel, all right. It ought to be a fine rest cure for my
tired nerves. (<i>Calls musically.</i>) Hello! (<i>Listens.</i>) My,

any one?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss C.</span> (<i>loudly</i>). Looking for&mdash;&mdash; Say, is this really
a hotel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Certainly. A little less noise, please. We&#8217;re
not used to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss C.</span> Oh, indeed. And who are you, please?</p>

manicure, stenographer, head cook and bottle washer. In
fact, I&#8217;m the whole force, except the porter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss C.</span> (<i>dazed</i>). Oh, except the porter. I see. So
you are in full charge of the hotel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Am I! If I quit the place it will have to close
up and move to (<i>name near-by town</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss C.</span> You must be a very important person in this
hotel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span> (<i>calmly</i>). I am. I own it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Yes. You see they owed me so much in wages
it was cheaper to just give me the hotel than to pay up in
cash.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss C.</span> Well, you&#8217;re lucky. (<i>Looks about</i>.) It looks
like a fine place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Best in the country. You get three meals a day
here, and at each meal four kinds of meat&mdash;ram, lamb,
sheep and mutton.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss C.</span> But I don&#8217;t like mutton.</p>

what you don&#8217;t like. You like meals, don&#8217;t you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Well, that&#8217;s what you get here&mdash;meals, just
plain meals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss C.</span> I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll like it here. When is the

hair, shifting two bureaus, setting the dining-room tables,

<p><span class="smcap">Miss C.</span> Well, I guess I&#8217;ll try it. The doctor has
ordered me to take a rest for a week.</p>

money?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss C.</span> Well, no. You see, I&#8217;m an actress, and I&#8217;ve

on the stage?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Walk on and make a bluff at it&mdash;the way I see
lots of them do at (<i>name local theatre</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rubber.</span> And put on lots of paint.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss C.</span> I never paint.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Neither do I. I belong to the Kalsominers&#8217;
Union. If you paint you can&#8217;t fool a woman for half a
minute, but you can fool almost any man for nearly two
minutes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss C.</span> Well, I&#8217;m thankful to say there&#8217;s nothing false
about me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Is that your own hair?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss C.</span> Yes, every curl and puff.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> How much did you pay for it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss C.</span> Nature gave it to me. I have only to pull out
a few hairpins and it falls down to my knees.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rubber.</span> If you&#8217;d pull &#8217;em all out it would fall down to
the floor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss C.</span> You&#8217;re a rude person. But we actresses have
to meet all kinds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rubber.</span> Oh, my! I guess I better apologize. If I said
anything I should be sorry for I&#8217;m glad of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> You must excuse him. He never had any
bringing up. Where was your father born?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rubber.</span> In San Francisco.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> And your mother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rubber.</span> In Boston.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Well, that accounts for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rubber.</span> For what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Your Chicago accent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rubber.</span> Now, don&#8217;t go springing jokes like that
on me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss C.</span> Oh, you&#8217;ll hear jokes a good deal worse than
that when you get on the stage. So you both want to act,
do you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> I&#8217;m crazy about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rubber</span> (<i>strutting around</i>). Just try me, dat&#8217;s all. I&#8217;m

<p>This work is the outgrowth of
actual class-room experience, and
is a practical, common-sense treatment
of the whole subject. It is
clear and concise, yet comprehensive,
and is absolutely free from
the entangling technicalities that are so frequently
found in books of this class.</p>

<p>Conversation, which is the basis of all true Elocution,
is regarded as embracing all the germs of
speech and action. Prominent attention is therefore
given to the cultivation of this the most common
form of human expression.</p>

<p>General principles and practical processes are presented
for the cultivation of strength, purity, and
flexibility of Voice, for the improvement of distinctness
and correctness in Articulation, and for the
development of Soul power in delivery.</p>

<p>The work includes a systematic treatment of Gesture
in its several departments of position, facial
expression, and bodily movement, a brief system of
Gymnastics bearing upon vocal development and
grace of movement, and also a chapter on Methods
of Instruction, for teachers.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
